# Google Earth Engine GOES-16/17 Fog Percentage Project

A small project I've been working on for deriving fog percentages by month from GOES-16 satellite data in GEE using Javascript. 

I was inspired to pursue this little project after reading a paper on GOES-derived fog and low cloud indices for coastal north and central California ecological analyses by Torregrosa et al. 2016 (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015EA000119). The USGS research team produced a Monthly Summertime Fog & Coastal Low Cloud Cover Dataset for North and Central Coastal California from 1999-2009 (http://climate.calcommons.org/dataset/monthly-summertime-fog), which is an amazing dataset for coastal ecological studies, but is rather old at this point. 

I wanted to see if I could recreate the steps needed to produce similar rasters in Google Earth Engine using GOES-16/17. The project is ongoing and I am taking it in steps to try to understand the intricacies of fog and low cloud cover derivations across the literature.
